                 <run full animated gifs as a wallpaper>

• probably not great with comps like picom


see ./gifw-desk.gif to see it in action

§ dependencies
• c compiler (gcc or clang)
• make
• x11 libraries and headers (xlib)

§ installation
git clone https://github.com/getjared/gifw.git
cd gifw

sudo make install


   
§ run it like you stole it
   
   ./gifw path/to/your/awesome.gif [stretch|center|tile]

gifw /home/user/wallpapers/avd.gif stretch &   
```
